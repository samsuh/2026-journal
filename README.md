# 2026-journal

1/1/26 
After an unintentional habit that turned into a test of consistency, I've decided to keep documenting my silly levels of progress and thoughts. I haven't been coding much lately, so github might not be the best place to keep this going, but it's what i've got without too much additional friction, so I'll stick with it until there's a better option. 

A summary of the 2025 one is that I lose a lot more time than I expect to when I go into autopilot mode. I can lose days or weeks at a time. I really think I have some form of ADHD, and the adhd term is "time blindness", which definitely seems to apply to me, along with a lot of habits that resonate pretty closely; most specifically, the hobby-collecting, dopamine-driven obsessive activity on certain topics. It's not all bad, and I like myself for the most part. 

One unintended consequence of the public journal is that some things that are a bit sensitive were released publically. It doesn't matter much because only one person reads this regularly (hi T), but i realized that not everything should be spoken about publicly, so some things will be held back due to some weird people being weird. 

Also, im going to write new stuff at the top so i dont have to scroll down.
