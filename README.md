Found this guide of getting from simple chords to jazz progress. 
https://youtu.be/jb5q-EY7iAw?si=f4Lc3MdRzpOf7GYb

1. Know major scales (all 12)
2. Learn major and minor chords (all 12)
3. Learn 7ths; major 7, dom 7, minor 7, dim 7, half dim 7 (all 12) 
4. Shells and guide tones (take a 7th chord, and remove 1 or 2 notes from teh chord to make a chord shell)
5. Extensions and alterations
6. Rootless voicings
7. Block chords
8. Drop 2 chords
9. Quartal voicings
10. Upper structures

These don't mean a lot to me yet, but a roadmap is a roadmap. Good to have some key points to look forward to.

Consistency is gonna be tough. I have to work in habits to regular rhythms to keep myself on track. The gym cadence is good, but i need something similar for music, and maybe a weekly event just to keep my life on a pulse. The weekly wednesday open mic night was good, but it hasnt happened over christmas/new years so it's been off the past few weeks. Need another weekly event to regularly attend. 

first practice session in the books. it was really simple. setting up the keyboard, since it's not an actual piano, and connecting it to the daw, making sure it all works, and that it makes sound. everything works. played a simple C major scale for a bit, with some left hand thrown in there making major chords in the C major scale. just the same shape moving up and down while i play the normal scale with my right hand. 

i couldnt figure out how to get the pedal to work with the keyboard, so that's troubleshooting i should do later. 

Djing practiced. Mixed a bunch of songs. got stuck around 5A around 100bpm and had nowhere to go. need to build out a bit more of a library to give myself more paths to go.

I've settled on two near years resolutions, and they both seem to revolve around music. 

1. Learn to play Keyboard and learn basics of music theory. Culmination: Write, record, and share one song created by me from scratch.
2. Learn to DJ to learn song structure and phrasing. Culmination: Perform a DJ set publicly somewhere in Seoul.

I've been learning that the little musical exposure I've had over the course of my life has not been directed properly, and that I really do want to have a creative outlet, and mastery of music as a skill set is something that I want to attain for myself. I know it takes years to master, but I'm confident I can get the basics down with a little focus and direction, and ideally, finding a method for me to pick it up is attainable as well. 

I found a video recommending that piano-for-music-production would benefit more from starting out down the jazz improvization path than the classical path, which totally makes sense to me. So i'll start by going through this video until i've extracted all the value from there. Hopefully that'll leave me in a good place to figure out what my next steps are.

He recommends learning the 'beginner' scale pattern, one key per month, practicing 5-10 mins per day until you can do it at 80bpm. this seems really doable for a month. 
- Learn notes of the major and minor scale in the key of C.
- practice the scale pattern with left hand making the chords from the key;
  - Going up: CEG (C Major), DFA (D Minor), EGB (E Minor), FAC (F Major), then continue with GBD (G Major), ACE (A Major), BDF (B Major), back to C chord.
  - Going down: CEG, BDF, ACE, GBD, then to FAC, EGB, DFA, to CEG
- then do it for the minor scale.
- Then in the next month, move to a different key, like F.

After an unintentional habit that turned into a test of consistency, I've decided to keep documenting my silly levels of progress and thoughts. I haven't been coding much lately, so github might not be the best place to keep this going, but it's what i've got without too much additional friction, so I'll stick with it until there's a better option. 

A summary of the 2025 one is that I lose a lot more time than I expect to when I go into autopilot mode. I can lose days or weeks at a time. I really think I have some form of ADHD, and the adhd term is "time blindness", which definitely seems to apply to me, along with a lot of habits that resonate pretty closely; most specifically, the hobby-collecting, dopamine-driven obsessive activity on certain topics. It's not all bad, and I like myself for the most part. 

One unintended consequence of the public journal is that some things that are a bit sensitive were released publically. It doesn't matter much because only one person reads this regularly (hi T), but i realized that not everything should be spoken about publicly, so some things will be held back due to some weird people being weird. 

Also, im going to write new stuff at the top so i dont have to scroll down.
