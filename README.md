# 2026-journal

I've settled on two near years resolutions, and they both seem to revolve around music. 

1. Learn to play Keyboard and learn basics of music theory. Culmination: Write, record, and share one song created by me from scratch.
2. Learn to DJ to learn song structure and phrasing. Culmination: Perform a DJ set publicly somewhere in Seoul.

I've been learning that the little musical exposure I've had over the course of my life has not been directed properly, and that I really do want to have a creative outlet, and mastery of music as a skill set is something that I want to attain for myself. I know it takes years to master, but I'm confident I can get the basics down with a little focus and direction, and ideally, finding a method for me to pick it up is attainable as well. 

I found a video recommending that piano-for-music-production would benefit more from starting out down the jazz improvization path than the classical path, which totally makes sense to me. So i'll start by going through this video until i've extracted all the value from there. Hopefully that'll leave me in a good place to figure out what my next steps are.

After an unintentional habit that turned into a test of consistency, I've decided to keep documenting my silly levels of progress and thoughts. I haven't been coding much lately, so github might not be the best place to keep this going, but it's what i've got without too much additional friction, so I'll stick with it until there's a better option. 

A summary of the 2025 one is that I lose a lot more time than I expect to when I go into autopilot mode. I can lose days or weeks at a time. I really think I have some form of ADHD, and the adhd term is "time blindness", which definitely seems to apply to me, along with a lot of habits that resonate pretty closely; most specifically, the hobby-collecting, dopamine-driven obsessive activity on certain topics. It's not all bad, and I like myself for the most part. 

One unintended consequence of the public journal is that some things that are a bit sensitive were released publically. It doesn't matter much because only one person reads this regularly (hi T), but i realized that not everything should be spoken about publicly, so some things will be held back due to some weird people being weird. 

Also, im going to write new stuff at the top so i dont have to scroll down.
